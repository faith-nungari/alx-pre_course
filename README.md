my dream life

Before I talk about my dream life I'd like to mention some of the things that motivated me to want this kind of life for myself.

- The fact that its possible to walk safely to death and when I say death I dont just mean the physical death I mean everything taht does not just symbolizes life and thriving.
- That for the world to functio ideally, we all have to step into the arena. The ideal is not always the case by default, its because some of us are too scared to live fully.
- The fact that nothing is impossible for a persistent and resilient soul.

That said, my dream life is one that I am living fully, one that fully present and one that I am filling every space with the fullness of who I am. One that I believe that I am enough and that I have been equiped with enough tecsources at any given time to conquer any challenge.This is my dream life and I am grateul that I am living my dream.
